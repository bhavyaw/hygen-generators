* Till the time we don't have a streamlined way of integrating 3rd party hygen generators in our project, We'll be keeping all the required \
Hygen generators here and accessing them using template property in .hygen.js config file
* Later on, when we have proper way of adding 3rd party hygen generators, I'll move them to their own repo's and packages once they are stable
and consume them in the projects from there itself
